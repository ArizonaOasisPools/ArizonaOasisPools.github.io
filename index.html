			<!--<div class="circle" style="float: right"><img src="img/kids-at-pool.jpg" style="width: 250px"/></div>-->
			<p>We are a professional family owned business based out of Chandler. We are committed to superior personal customer service and pride ourselves on our professionalism. As former professional employees we understand the importance of professionalism and trustworthiness. As Phoenix natives, we understand the difficulties associated with maintaining your swimming pool during the long hot summers. We strive to keep your pool at its best, so that all you have to worry about is enjoying yourself. As members of the <a href="http://www.ipssa.com/">Independent Pool and Spa Service Association (IPSSA)</a> we have both professional liability insurance and associates who will service your pools if one of us is injured. Most small pool service companies do not offer you that protection. We provide reliable high quality service and repairs at a reasonable price.</p>
